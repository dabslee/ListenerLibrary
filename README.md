Features to implement:
- Adding "artist" field to tracks
- Playback memory
    - Keep track of what track and where in the track a user is at at any given time; when the user navigates away from the site or goes to a new page, start them at that point in that track
    - For tracks with type "podcast", further track for each individual podcast track where the user last left off. If the user plays a different track and then comes back to play the podcast track, start them at the point they last left off in the podcast track.
